# Wine-Store-Employee-Retention-Analysis

## Overview
This project aims to analyze and predict employee retention for a fictitious wine store. The analysis is based on a dataset containing various attributes related to employees, such as their roles, the number of sales they made, and other factors. The goal is to identify key factors influencing employee turnover and to develop a predictive model to help the store manage employee retention more effectively.

## Project Structure
- **Final_Wine_Store_Employee_Retention_Analysis.ipynb**: The Jupyter notebook containing all the code and analysis steps.
- **Datasets**: (Optional) Include a brief description of any datasets used if they are also uploaded to the repository.

## Analysis Steps
1. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, removing irrelevant columns, and ensuring data types are appropriate.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Exploring relationships between different features and the target variable (employee retention).
3. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features, encoding categorical variables, and addressing multicollinearity.
4. **Feature Selection**: Identifying the most relevant features for the predictive model.
5. **Modeling**: Building and fine-tuning various machine learning models to predict employee retention.
6. **Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Key Findings

## Tools and Libraries Used
- **Python**: Programming language used for the analysis.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning models and evaluation.
